# Smart Contract Framework

The smart contract framework provides consistent APIs across several programming languages that programmers can use to manipulate state on the blockchain.

The smart contract framework currently supports [.NET Framework](fw/dotnet.md), Java framework and its respective compiler will be released within a few months. In the future, we will also support Python, C/C++, and Go.
