# Network Protocol


FRS adopts a P2P network structure, in which nodes can communicate with each other through TCP/IP protocol. In this structure, there are two different types of nodes: peer nodes and validating nodes (referred to as Bookkeepers in the FRS Whitepaper). Peer nodes can broadcast, receive and transfer transactions or blocks, while validating node can create blocks.


The network protocol of FRS is roughly similar to bitcoin’s, however, data structures such as blocks or transactions are quite different.

Convention
----

1. Byte Order

    All integer types of FRS are Little Endian except for IP address and port number, these 2 are Big Endian.

1. Hash

   Two different hash functions are used in FRS: SHA256 and RIPEMD160. SHA256 is used to generate a long hash value, and RIPEMD160 is used to generate a short hash value. In general, we get an object's hash value by using hash function twice. For example, we use SHA256 twice when we want to generate block's or transaction's hash value. When generating a contract address, we will use SHA256 function first and then use RIPEMD160.

   In addition, the block will also use a hash structure called a Merkle Tree. It computes the hash of each transaction and combines one another then hash again, repeats this process until there is only one root hash (Merkle Root).

1. Variable Length Type

   + Variant: Variable length integer, can be encoded to save space according to the value typed.

      |Value|Length|Format|
      |---|---|---|
      |< 0xfd|1|uint8|
      |<= 0xffff|3|0xfd + uint16|
      |<= 0xffffffff|5|0xfe + uint32|
      |> 0xffffffff|9|0xff + uint64|

   + Varstr: Variable length string, consisting of variable length integer followed by strings. String encoded by UTF8.

      |Size|Field|DataType|Description|
      |---|---|---|---|
      |?|length|variant|The length of a string in bytes|
      |length|string|uint8[length]|string itself|

   + Array: The array consists of a variable length integer followed by a sequence of elements.

1. Fixed-point Number

   Data in FRS such as amount or price are 64 bit fixed-point number and the precision of decimal part is 10<sup>-8</sup>，range：[-2<sup>63</sup>/10<sup>8</sup>, +2<sup>63</sup>/10<sup>8</sup>)

Data Type
-------

1. Blockchain

   The blockchain is a kind of logical structure, which is connected in series with a one-way linked list. It is used to store the data of the whole network, such as transactions or assets.

1. Block

   |Size|Field|DataType|Description|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |4|Version|uint32|Version of the block which is 0 for now|
   |32|PrevBlock|uint256|Hash value of the previous block|
   |32|MerkleRoot|uint256|Root hash of a transaction list|
   |4|Timestamp|uint32|Time-stamp|
   |4|Height|uint32|Height of block|
   |8|Nonce|uint64|Random number|
   |20|NextMiner|uint160|Contract address of next miner|
   |1|-|uint8|It's fixed to 1|
   |?|Script|script|Script used to validate the block|
   |?*?|Transactions|tx[]|Transactions list|

   When calculating the hash value of the block, instead of calculating the entire block, only first seven fields in the block head will be calculated, which are version, PrevBlock, MerkleRoot, timestamp, and height, the nonce, NextMiner. Since MerkleRoot already contains the hash value of all transactions, the modification of transaction will influence the hash value of the block.

   Data structure of block head:

   |Size|Field|DataType|Description|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |4|Version|uint32|Version of the block which is 0 for now|
   |32|PrevBlock|uint256|Hash value of the previous block|
   |32|MerkleRoot|uint256|Root hash of a transaction list|
   |4|Timestamp|uint32|Time-stamp|
   |4|Height|uint32|Height of block|
   |8|Nonce|uint64|Random number|
   |20|NextMiner|uint160|Contract address of next miner|
   |1|-|uint8|It's fixed to 1|
   |?|Script|script|Script used to validate the block|
   |1|-|uint8|It's fixed to 0|

   The time-stamp of each block must be later than previous block's time stamp. Generally the difference of two block's time stamp is about 15 seconds and imprecision is allowed. The height of the block must be exactly equal to the height of the previous block plus 1.

1. Transaction

   |Size|Field|DataType|Description|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |1|Type|uint8|Type of transaction|
   |1|Version|uint8|Trading version, currently 0|
   |?|-|-|Data specific to transaction types|
   |?*?|Attributes|tx_attr[]|Additional features that the transaction has|
   |34*?|Inputs|tx_in[]|Input|
   |60*?|Outputs|tx_out[]|Output|
   |?*?|Scripts|script[]|List of scripts used to validate the transaction|

   All processes in FRS system are recorded as transactions. There are several types of transactions:

   |Value|Name|System Fee|Description|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |0x00|MinerTransaction|0|Assign byte fees|
   |0x01|IssueTransaction|500\|0|Inssuance of asset|
   |0x02|ClaimTransaction|0|Assign GAS|
   |0x20|EnrollmentTransaction|1000|Enrollment for validator|
   |0x40|RegisterTransaction|10000|Assets register|
   |0x80|ContractTransaction|0|Contract transaction|
   |0xd0|PublishTransaction|500 * n|(Not usable) Special Transactions for Smart Contracts|
   |0xd1|InvocationTransaction|0|Special transactions for calling Smart Contracts|

   Each type of transaction, in addition to the public field, also has its own exclusive field. The following will describe these exclusive fields in detail.

   + MinerTransaction

      |Size|Field|DataType|Description|
      |---|---|---|---|
      |4|Nonce|uint32|random number|

      The first transaction in each block must be MinerTransaction. It is used to reward all transaction fees of the current block to the validator.

      Random number in the transaction is used to avoid hash collision.

   + IssueTransaction

      There are no special fields for an issue transaction.

      Asset managers can create the assets that have been registered in FRS's block chain through IssueTransaction, and sent them to any address.

      In particular, if the assets which being issued are FRS, then the transaction will be sent free.

      Random number in the transaction is used to avoid hash collision.

   + ClaimTransaction

      |Size|Field|DataType|Description|
      |---|---|---|---|
      |34*?|Claims|tx_in[]|FRS for distribution|

   + EnrollmentTransaction

      |Size|Field|DataType|Description|
      |---|---|---|---|
      |33|PublicKey|ec_point|public key of validator|

      The transaction represents an enrollment form, which indicates that the sponsor of the transaction would like to sign up as a validator.

      The way to sign up is: To construct an EnrollmentTransaction type of transaction, and send a deposit to the address of the PublicKey.

      The way to cancel the registration is: Spend the deposit on the address of the PublicKey.

   + RegisterTransaction

      > [!Warning]
      Has been deactived and replaced by FRS.Asset.Create for the smart contract.

   + ContractTransaction

      There are no special attributes for a contract transaction. This is a very common kind of transaction as it allows one wallet to send FRS to another. The `inputs` and `outputs` transaction fields will usually be important for this transaction (for example, to govern how much FRS will be sent, and to what address).

   + PublishTransaction

      > [!Warning]
      Has been deactivated and replaced by FRS.Contract.Create for the smart contract.

   When a node receives the version message, it replies with a verack immediately.

   This message has no payload.

1. getaddr

   Make requests to a node for a batch of new active nodes in order to increase the number of connections.

   This message has no payload.

1. addr
