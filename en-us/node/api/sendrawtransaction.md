Request text:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sendrawtransaction",
  "params": [ "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"],
  "id": 1
}
```

Response text:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": false
}
```

Response Description:

When the result is true, the current transaction has been successfully broadcasted to the network.

When result is false, the current transaction has failed to broadcast. There are many reasons for this, such as double spend, incomplete signature, etc.

In this example, a confirmed transaction was already broadcasted, so the second broadcast failed due to double spend.
