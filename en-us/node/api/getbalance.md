# Getbalance method

Returns the balance of the corresponding asset in the wallet, based on the specified asset number.

> [!Note]
> You will need to open the wallet in the FRS-CLI node before executing this command.

## Parameter Description

Asset_id: Asset ID (asset identifier), which is the transaction ID of the RegistTransaction when the asset is registered.

For FRS: c56f33fc6ecfcd0c225c4ab356fee59390af8560be0e930faebe74a6daff7c9b

For GAS: 602c79718b16e442de58778e148d0b1084e3b2dffd5de6b7b16cee7969282de7

The remaining asset IDs can be queried through the `list asset` command in [CLI Command](../cli.md) or in the Block Chain Browser.

## Example 

Request text:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getbalance",
  "params": ["025d82f7b00a9ff1cfe709abe3c4741a105d067178e645bc3ebad9bc79af47d4"],
  "id": 1
}
```

Response text:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
  "Balance": "1.01",
  "Confirmed": "1.01"
  }
}
```

Response Description:

Balance: The actual balance of the asset in the wallet.

Confirmed: The exact amount of the asset in the wallet, where only confirmed amounts can be used for transfer.

Balance and Confirmed values may not be equal. This happens when there is an output transaction from the wallet, and the change has not been confirmed yet, so the confirmed value will be less than the balance. Once the deal is confirmed, the two will become equal.
